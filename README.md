## About Me

Hello! I'm Alex Pozs√°r, a Senior Technical Writer & Documentation Specialist based in Hungary. I have over 6 years of experience in crafting documentation and working with diverse content. My expertise lies in creating end-user documentation, developer guides, training materials, and case studies to enhance user experience and understanding. üìö‚úçÔ∏è

Currently, I'm a Documentation Specialist at platformOS, contributing to DocsKit and writing user guides for customer projects. In my prior role as a Lead Technical Writer at Pronovix, I spearheaded documentation creation for the Zero Gravity Developer Portal and Drupal-based developer portals, showcasing leadership in process establishment, team mentoring, and fostering collaboration.

Beyond my role, I have a profound passion for writing and sharing knowledge. üñãÔ∏è I believe in the power of words to simplify complexities and bridge understanding. I also had the incredible honor of co-hosting the API the Docs podcast üéôÔ∏è, where I delved into insightful conversations about the art and impact of technical writing.

Committed to delivering not just documentation, but compelling, valuable, and consumable texts that both inform and inspire. üöÄ
